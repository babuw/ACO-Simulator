# ACO-Simulator


Ant Colony Optimization Simulator. In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) 
wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone
trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random,
but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food.
This simulator shows how ants with difference intelligence can help each other to find food.
